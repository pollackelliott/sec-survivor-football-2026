# SEC Survivor Football 2026

A mobile-first survivor pool application for SEC college football, letting players sign up, submit weekly picks, and track live standings — fully self-service, with every eligibility rule and deadline enforced server-side rather than trusted to the browser.

The project demonstrates an end-to-end application built on **Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Row-Level Security)** for identity and business logic, **GitHub Actions** for automated score ingestion, and a **vanilla JavaScript** front end deployed on **GitHub Pages**.

The application provides participants with self-serve account creation, a dynamically filtered weekly pick menu, live standings, automatic elimination tracking, and a commissioner administration panel.

## Overview

SEC Survivor Football is a season-long "survivor" pick 'em application: each week, players pick one SEC team to win outright, and a loss means elimination. Rather than a manually-maintained spreadsheet, the application runs on a real backend — player accounts, pick submission, schedule and score ingestion, and every eligibility rule are enforced by the database itself, not by client-side logic that could be bypassed.

The project functions as a small, fully operational multiplayer web application: real authentication, server-enforced business rules, and unattended data pipelines, rather than a static leaderboard.
