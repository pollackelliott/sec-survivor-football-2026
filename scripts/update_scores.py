"""
Pulls every FBS game involving an SEC team for a given week from ESPN's
public (unofficial) scoreboard endpoint, and upserts the results into the
Supabase `games` table.

Env vars required (set as GitHub Actions secrets):
  SUPABASE_URL          e.g. https://xxxxx.supabase.co
  SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY  the service_role key (NOT the anon key — this needs
                         write access and must never be shipped to the browser)

Usage:
  python update_scores.py --week 3
  python update_scores.py --week 3 --year 2026
